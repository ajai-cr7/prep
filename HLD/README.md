**How to learn?** :
  1. Practial Experience in a company is best. Designing a High Scale System with Many Edge Cases and Thinking About Resiliency!
  2. Choose a question to practice. Use excalidraw to draw the initial high level design and make sure its adhering to FR and NFR! If you have any open questions, then write it down. Ask chatGPT and research a lot to understand it. Need to spend some time here. Then see answer key. Either Read Books or Blogs and then see some YT videos. Bridge the Gap that you had During Initial Design. Then REPEAT For Many And Many Questions Till You Feel Confident!
