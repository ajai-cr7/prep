- Functional requirements - Adapt to changing requirements.
- Non-functional requirements. Cap theorem.
- Back of the envelop estimations.
- extensible, scalable, maintainable HLD. (Architectural patterns)
- Answer why in the design choices, this will articulate the tradeoffs that you are making,Sequence diagram ,various data acess patterns and their tradeoffs , various hld components like load balancer, cache, kafka.
- DB choice and design and algorithm for each service.
- Use diagrams to explain.Draw in excalidraw.



Note : 
- The people who pass system design interviews are not the smartest. They are the most prepared.
- Discuss A Certain Reason on why a particular Architectural decision was made.  
- Write Down All Trade Offs Before choosing or making a design architecture decision. So that why you chose nosql over sql etc.. question can be avoided.
- Entire System Design Is All About Taking Decisions on design and architecture and completely depends on TradeOffs and Requirements.
- When you discuss the tradeoffs you make the right Architectural Decisions
- Summarize tradeoff for each Architectural Decision.  
- Point out bottlenecks and single points of failure. 
- When we understand the interviewers expectation then we have better chance of passing. Ask whether Api, DB Schema Design and 
Capacity planning are essential. 
- Do many mock interviews. 
- Validate the Final Fesign Against Requirements.  
- List down what can be improved at end if we have more time.  List cross cutting concern like monitoring leggings.
