Wayfair Low Level design retros: (Basically they tested whether I know few things in-depth in detail --> Only if i have Worked on them then Only I Will Be Able to Answer --> Also Internal working of few things)

* If There Are Two Actors Interacting in the System say Admin and End User , then try to write a Interface Called Actor or Human and Extend 2 Classes Called user, Admin to give special functionalities! (OOPS functionality!)
* Try Writing Paginated Query in a paginated API! (Pagination API)
* DB Composite Indexing and Non-Clustered Indexing! (Query Execution Plan + Writing Optimised Queries With Indexing!)
* IN a Paginated Api where you will pass the page number? As path params or query params or header?  (Basically API Design in-depth)
* Write JOIN Query! (SQL Query + How It Works Internally!)

 PRODUCT
 - PRODUCT_ID
 - PRODUCT_TYPE
 - STATUS (AVAILABLE, RENTED)
 - SIZE 

 RENTALS
 - RENTAL_ID 
 - USER_ID
 - CHARGE 
 - START_TIME
 - RETURN_TIME
 - PRODUCT_ID
 - DUE_DATE

* If You Want To Calculate The Overdue Rows of products, Then Just Try To introduce a field called DUE_DATE and do comparisons --> No Need Of Join Queries Itself! ðŸ«¡
* Avoid Writing Nested Query!
* Should be able to Draw the Class Diagrams Quickly Without Searching for the Correct Symbols in draw.io 
* Should Be Able To Break Down Requirements Into Proper Entities!

Machine Coding Round:
* Internal Working Of HashMap + Equals And HashCode! ðŸ«¡
* Should have muscle memory on containers and collections!
* Need To Code More For Many Problems!



- Go Through Every Single Topic and Understand it Deeply and Apply it in your project or somewhere during Practicing + Ask chatGPT and learn top 20 FAQs in every single topic like kafka, splunk, jenkins, java streams, SQL etc.. 
- See ATLAS Repos and understand code structure and explore things like @oneToOne etc + see Ishaan's PR's ðŸ«¡ (StalK)
