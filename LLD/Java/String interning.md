Great! Let's explain **string interning** in **simple, clear terms** 👇

---

## 🔄 What is **String Interning**?

> **String interning** means storing **only one copy** of each distinct string **literal** in a special memory area called the **string pool** (or intern pool).

---

### 📦 Analogy:

Imagine you write `"Ajai"` in multiple places in your code.

Instead of storing **separate copies** of `"Ajai"` each time, Java stores **just one**, and **reuses it** wherever needed.

---

### 🧪 Example:

```java
String a = "hello";
String b = "hello";

System.out.println(a == b);  // ✅ true → both point to same object
```

✅ Because `"hello"` is interned — only **one object** is created in the pool.

---

### 🧵 Memory Optimization

Without interning:

```java
String a = new String("hello");
String b = new String("hello");

System.out.println(a == b);  // ❌ false → two separate objects
```

With interning:

```java
String a = new String("hello").intern();
String b = new String("hello").intern();

System.out.println(a == b);  // ✅ true
```

---

## ⚙️ How it works:

* All **string literals** in Java are **automatically interned**.
* You can **manually intern** a string using:

  ```java
  String interned = str.intern();
  ```

It will:

* Check the pool.
* If the string already exists → return that reference.
* If not → add the new string to the pool.

---

### ✅ Benefits:

| Feature           | Benefit                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Memory efficiency | No duplicate strings in memory               |
| Fast comparison   | Can use `==` instead of `.equals()`          |
| Pooling speed     | Reuse common values like `"OK"`, `"id"` etc. |

---

### ⚠️ Caution:

* **String pool is limited** in size.
* Overusing `intern()` on dynamically created strings can bloat memory (especially pre-Java 7 where pool was in PermGen space).

---

### ✅ Summary:

> **String interning** stores one shared copy of each unique literal in memory, enabling **reuse**, **faster comparisons**, and **less memory waste**.
