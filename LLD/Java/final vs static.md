The keywords static and final in Java serve distinct purposes related to memory management and immutability, respectively. 
static Keyword: 

• Class-level association: The static keyword indicates that a member (variable, method, or nested class) belongs to the class itself, rather than to any specific instance (object) of that class. 
• Shared resources: Static variables are shared among all instances of a class, meaning there's only one copy in memory, regardless of how many objects are created. Changes to a static variable by one instance are visible to all other instances. 
• Direct access: Static members can be accessed directly using the class name, without needing to create an object of the class. 
• Memory efficiency: Using static for shared data can improve memory efficiency by avoiding redundant copies of data across multiple objects. [1]  

final Keyword: 

• Immutability: The final keyword ensures that a variable, method, or class cannot be modified or extended after its initial declaration. 
• Final Variables: A final variable can only be assigned a value once. Once initialized, its value cannot be changed. This makes them suitable for defining constants. 
• Final Methods: A final method cannot be overridden by subclasses, ensuring that its implementation remains consistent throughout the inheritance hierarchy. 
• Final Classes: A final class cannot be subclassed, preventing inheritance and ensuring that its behavior cannot be extended or modified. 

Key Differences: 

| Feature | static | final  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Class-level | Variable, method, or class level  |
| Purpose | Memory management, shared resources | Immutability, preventing modification/extension  |
| Modification | Can be reinitialized (for variables) | Cannot be reinitialized (for variables)  |
| Inheritance | Not directly related to inheritance | Restricts inheritance (for classes) and overriding (for methods)  |
| Access | Accessible via class name | Accessible based on standard access modifiers  |

Combined Use (static final): 
When static and final are used together (e.g., public static final int CONSTANT_VALUE), it creates a constant that is both shared across all instances of the class and whose value cannot be changed after initialization. This is a common pattern for defining true constants in Java.
