**Notes:**

- Properly declare Enums.
- Get Inputs from file or from STDIN.
- Use Design Patterns - Singleton Pattern , Factory Pattern wherever needed.
- Use SOLID Principles Wherever Needed!
- Write thread safe code!
- Use try-catch blocks if possible!
- Learn Date and Comparator Operations!
- Complete Basic functionalities and then move to bonus ones!
- See lot of other solutions and try to refactor them as needed! (https://github.com/ashishps1/awesome-low-level-design/tree/main). Try to code one on your own. Then try to ReFactor and also ask CHATGPT/GENAI for evaluation! This is correct practice as i'll do some coding - write some stream functions and also i can do java 21 as well!
