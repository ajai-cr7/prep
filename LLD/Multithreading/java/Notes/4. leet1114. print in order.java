/*

The wait() and notifyAll() methods always require the current thread to own the intrinsic lock of the object.

An "intrinsic lock" in Java is a built-in lock mechanism associated with every object, essentially acting as a "key" that ensures only one
thread can access and modify the object's state at a time, preventing race conditions when multiple threads try to access the same data;
it's also known as a "monitor lock". 

Key points about intrinsic locks:

- Every object has one: Every object created in Java automatically has its own intrinsic lock. 
- Exclusive access: When a thread acquires an object's intrinsic lock, it gains exclusive access to that object, 
    preventing other threads from modifying its state until the lock is released. 
- Synchronized keyword: In Java, the "synchronized" keyword is used to explicitly mark code blocks that require access to an object's 
    intrinsic lock.
