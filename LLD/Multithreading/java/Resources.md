**chatGPT:**
Give me some 10 problems statements regarding multithreading in java and also give 2 similar problems to each 10 problems which requuires changing small thing to solve. 


I completely understand that jumping into multithreading can feel overwhelming, but with a structured approach, you can gradually build a solid understanding of the concepts and how to implement them in Java. I'll provide a series of **10 problem statements** related to multithreading in Java, followed by **2 variations of each problem** that require a small change in your approach. This way, you can practice core concepts and get used to handling different variations.

### **Structured Approach to Learning Multithreading in Java**

1. **Start with Basics**:
   - Learn **Thread Lifecycle** (Creating, starting, sleeping, waiting, joining, etc.).
   - Understand **Runnable** interface vs **Thread** class.
   - Study how to **synchronize** methods/blocks to avoid race conditions.

2. **Practice with Simple Problems**:
   - Implement simple problems where you use `Thread` and `Runnable`.
   - Try using `ExecutorService` to handle thread pools.

3. **Advance to Complex Patterns**:
   - Learn how to handle **deadlocks**, **race conditions**, and **thread safety**.
   - Explore **`CompletableFuture`** for asynchronous programming.
   - Understand **Thread synchronization** using `ReentrantLock`, `synchronized`, etc.

### **Multithreading Problems & Variations**

#### **1. Problem 1: Print Numbers from 1 to 10 using Two Threads**
- **Description**: You have two threads. One thread should print even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) and the other should print odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). Print the numbers in correct sequence using synchronization or wait/notify.

**Variation 1**: Print numbers from 1 to 20, where one thread prints multiples of 3 and another prints multiples of 5.

**Variation 2**: Print numbers from 1 to 10, but use an `ExecutorService` to handle the threads instead of manually creating `Thread` objects.

---

#### **2. Problem 2: Producer-Consumer Problem**
- **Description**: Implement a simple producer-consumer problem using threads. The producer will add items to a queue, and the consumer will consume them. Use wait/notify or semaphores to manage synchronization.

**Variation 1**: Implement the producer-consumer problem with bounded buffer (maximum size of the queue).

**Variation 2**: Modify the producer-consumer problem to use **`BlockingQueue`** instead of manually using `wait()` and `notify()`.

---

#### **3. Problem 3: Create a Thread Pool to Calculate Factorials**
- **Description**: Use a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to calculate the factorial of numbers concurrently. Submit several tasks to the thread pool, each calculating a factorial.

**Variation 1**: Use **`ExecutorService`** to submit tasks, but instead of calculating factorials, calculate Fibonacci numbers.

**Variation 2**: Implement the factorial calculation using **`CompletableFuture`** instead of `ExecutorService` and return the results as `Future`.

---

#### **4. Problem 4: Simulate a Bank Account with Multiple Threads**
- **Description**: Create a `BankAccount` class that allows multiple threads to deposit and withdraw money. Use synchronization to avoid race conditions.

**Variation 1**: Use an `AtomicInteger` for the balance instead of synchronizing the `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods.

**Variation 2**: Introduce a **deadlock** scenario by making two threads attempt to lock multiple accounts in different orders and try to avoid it.

---

#### **5. Problem 5: Implement a Simple Countdown Timer using Threads**
- **Description**: Create a countdown timer using a thread. The thread will count down from a specified time and display each number as it counts down.

**Variation 1**: Modify the countdown timer so that it supports pausing and resuming the countdown using a separate control thread.

**Variation 2**: Change the timer to count down every second and display the remaining time in a `ScheduledExecutorService`.

---

#### **6. Problem 6: Implementing Deadlock Prevention**
- **Description**: Simulate a simple scenario where two threads are trying to access two resources in a way that causes a deadlock. Then, modify the code to prevent the deadlock using **timeouts** or **lock ordering**.

**Variation 1**: Introduce a third resource and show how a **deadlock** can occur with three threads and prevent it using lock ordering.

**Variation 2**: Use **`ReentrantLock`** with **`tryLock`** instead of the `synchronized` block and implement timeout-based lock acquisition.

---

#### **7. Problem 7: Implement a Simple Barrier for Multiple Threads**
- **Description**: Create a scenario where 5 threads perform a task and must all reach a barrier before they continue with their work. Use a `CyclicBarrier` to synchronize their progress.

**Variation 1**: Implement a barrier using `CountDownLatch` instead of `CyclicBarrier`.

**Variation 2**: Instead of waiting for all threads to reach the barrier, create a scenario where a certain number of threads must reach the barrier to continue, and use a `Semaphore` to control access.

---

#### **8. Problem 8: Simulate a Race with Multiple Cars (Threads)**
- **Description**: Create several threads to simulate cars racing. Each car moves forward a random distance, and the race finishes when a car reaches the finish line. Display the progress of each car.

**Variation 1**: Instead of random distance, have each car move forward by a fixed amount, but change the speed at which each car moves.

**Variation 2**: Modify the problem so that you track the **fastest** car using a `SharedVariable` and synchronize access to the variable.

---

#### **9. Problem 9: Implementing a Thread-Safe Singleton**
- **Description**: Implement a thread-safe Singleton pattern. Use `synchronized` or **double-checked locking** to ensure that only one instance of the class is created.

**Variation 1**: Use **`Bill Pugh Singleton`** (Static Inner Class) for implementing thread-safe Singleton without synchronization.

**Variation 2**: Modify the singleton to use **`enum`** for thread-safe instantiation.

---

#### **10. Problem 10: Calculate Pi Using Multiple Threads**
- **Description**: Use multiple threads to calculate the value of Pi using the **Monte Carlo method**. Each thread will calculate a part of the result, and the final result will be combined.

**Variation 1**: Use a **`ForkJoinPool`** instead of simple threads to divide the work and compute Pi more efficiently.

**Variation 2**: Implement the Monte Carlo method but modify the problem so that the number of points is user-defined, and then use a `CompletionService` to manage results from multiple threads.

---

### **How to Approach Solving These Problems**

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the basic version of each problem. For instance, try solving problem 1 (Printing numbers) by just creating threads and using basic synchronization like `Thread.sleep` or `wait/notify`.
   
2. **Understand Synchronization**: Ensure you understand how `synchronized`, `ReentrantLock`, and `Atomic` variables work, as these will be crucial for avoiding race conditions and deadlocks.

3. **Expand Gradually**: After solving the basic problem, try tackling the variations. They often require applying the same concepts in slightly different ways, helping you build a deeper understanding.

4. **Use Tools Like `ExecutorService`**: For problems that involve managing multiple threads, learn how to use `ExecutorService`, `ScheduledExecutorService`, and `CompletionService`. These make managing tasks much easier.

5. **Test and Debug**: Always test your solution with multiple threads running simultaneously. You may encounter issues like race conditions or deadlocks that require debugging.

6. **Learn By Doing**: The more problems you solve, the more confident you'll become in managing threads in Java.

By tackling these problems, you'll cover a wide range of concepts in multithreading and concurrency, from basic synchronization to advanced topics like thread pooling, deadlock prevention, and asynchronous programming with `CompletableFuture`.
