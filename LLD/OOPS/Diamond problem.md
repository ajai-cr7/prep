The diamond problem in Java refers to an ambiguity issue that arises in the context of multiple inheritance, specifically when a class inherits from two parent classes (or interfaces) that share a common ancestor and both parents override a method from that ancestor. [1, 2, 3]  
Explanation: 

• Common Ancestor: Imagine a base class (or interface) A with a method m(). 
• Intermediate Classes: Two classes (or interfaces) B and C extend (or implement) A, and both B and C override the method m(), providing their own distinct implementations. 
• Derived Class: A class D then attempts to inherit from both B and C. 
• Ambiguity: When an object of class D calls the method m(), the Java compiler faces ambiguity because it doesn't know whether to invoke the implementation of m() from B or from C. This creates a "diamond" shape in the inheritance hierarchy, hence the name. 

Java's Approach to the Diamond Problem: 

• Classes: Java prevents the diamond problem for classes by disallowing multiple inheritance of classes directly. A class can only extend one other class. This eliminates the possibility of a class inheriting conflicting method implementations from multiple class hierarchies. 
• Interfaces and Default Methods (Java 8+): With the introduction of default methods in interfaces in Java 8, the diamond problem can potentially arise with interfaces. If a class implements two interfaces that both define the same default method, and the class itself does not override that method, ambiguity occurs. [4]  
	• Resolution: To resolve this, the implementing class must explicitly override the conflicting default method and specify which interface's implementation to use, or provide its own new implementation. This is achieved using the InterfaceName.super.methodName() syntax. 

```java
Example (Interfaces): 
interface InterfaceA {
    default void display() {
        System.out.println("InterfaceA display");
    }
}
```

```java
interface InterfaceB extends InterfaceA {
    default void display() {
        System.out.println("InterfaceB display");
    }
}
```

```java
interface InterfaceC extends InterfaceA {
    default void display() {
        System.out.println("InterfaceC display");
    }
}
```

```java
class MyClass implements InterfaceB, InterfaceC {
    // Explicitly resolving the diamond problem
    @Override
    public void display() {
        // Option 1: Call a specific interface's default method
        InterfaceB.super.display(); 
        // Option 2: Provide a new implementation
        // System.out.println("MyClass display");
    }
}
```
